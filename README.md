## Project 2: The earth beneath us

## Guideline:

- clone this repo and read the module description
- read through the Map Tutorial [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-pbd7xuD7Aprm2oecZHX-VAc263pCsSjMs3ONCVTf_Y/edit?tab=t.0)

### Project Structure

- `css` folder: stores all the styling files
- `data` folder: stores .csv files
- `images` folder: stores any images used in the page
- `js` folder: stores all the bts `js` code
- `documentation` folder: stores any documentation

### Coordinating plan

- We will meet 2 times a week for updates. We prefer to have in-person meeting during weekday after class or any necessary online meeting after class

- We will used branches for commiting our code to the online code base and will have a code review before merging any branches to main

### Sketches

![alt text](image.png)

This is the basic leaflet.

Level 2 approach:

We have some ideas to approach this problem

- We will have the changes in map data overtime, showing data point overtime
- We can have 2 map standing to each other to compare the changes between 2 periods
- We can also use color scale effects (fading and changing color + opacity to show the changes)

Level 3 + 4 approach:

We decide to have different color scale for different attributes. A selection will be used to toggle between the attributes

Brushing + Linking: will be used to zoomed in and scanned.

### Timeline

- 3.10 - 3.16: Pre-Project Preparation: Team members will spend their time to read the documentation, do their own researches and play with leaflet D3.
- 3.17 - 3.23: Brainstorming and Sketching in the first half, and try to implement our sketches
- 3.23 - 3.29: Finalizing our design and deploy our product
